My name is Josh Stewart. I've had a wild ride over the last 11 years but I would not have been able to get through it without a lot of support from my beautiful wife, Nicki, my family back home in Maryland (both extended and immediate), my girls, and my faith. 

I'm on a journey from late May 2017 until August 2017 to become a web-developer through a Bootcamp at Awesome Inc., in Lexington, Kentucky. It's been great so far and part of the reason you've found this website that you're on now. I built it, with some help and a few headaches of course. 

I hope to keep this updated as often as I can. It's cool to keep tabs on people, and this is a way I can do that. 

Thanks for the support. It means a lot. 

Josh
