Phew... surprised I even have the energy to write anything about anything after the week I've had. Between coaching and dad-ing and going to class full-time with loads of work in between I've come to the conclusion that God did not make enough hours in the day (or He just didn't make me last long enough during said days).

Either way I got a nice re-introduction into the world of javascript (JS) this week during class. It's my little ode to it in the title. Console.log in JS just means simply "print this value in the console to see if you know what you're doing is going to actually work at this point in time". It's been a good friend to me over the past four days. 

Oh yeah, right, four days. Monday was Memorial day. It was the day my Terps from Maryland captured their first NCAA DI Men's Lacrosse Championship since 1975 breaking an 0-for-9 streak at the National Championship in the process. And that also meant Saturday was the 27th of May and it was Nicki and I's 10th anniversary. 

Actually, neither of us really noticed until like 1 o'clock in the afternoon and even then we were kinda 'eh' about it. It's a big deal, no doubt, but we celebrated with a weekend away before this whole class thing started. 

Anyway- back on topic. Javascript. It does some sick stuff. IF you can get the syntax of the language down and can have some patience. Between the cuss words of defeat and victory I was able to come up with three really solid perojects this week. We made a tic-tac-toe game board in the browser. We made a calculator. And a weather app. 

And tonight we added Minesweeper to that list. Remember that fantastic game? It's great, IMO. I'll include a screenshot of it below because it isn't finished but it will be soon. 

I've also included links to the things I've created this week and hopefully they work. My calculator admittedly isnt all that great. I had no motivation to sift through that a calculator can and will do with just the typical operands of +/-/%/x. No thanks. 

Anyway- thanks for checking in. 

If you've got an idea for a sweet project that I could work on that you've been thinking about or you think I could provide a service to you, I'm still looking for a final project to work on for the class. It's gonna be big and I want it to be "right" for me. 

[miWeather](https://jmstewart00.github.io/weatherapp/index.html) - find your local current conditions via zipcode
[calulator](https://jmstewart00.github.io/calculator/index.html) - do some basic math. It's super buggy though. Good luck.

Thanks.
