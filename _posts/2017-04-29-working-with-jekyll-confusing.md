This is my second attempt at launching a Jekyll site. I found it incredibly rewarding the first time I did it, but ultimately ended up frustrated with the end result. I hope this time turns out better. 

I'm really looking forward to what the next day of this course brings and what the next chapter of my life may come because of it. 

Thanks for checking this out! Stay tuned for more!
